# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the amount of employees that will be retiring from Pewlett Hackard per title and from those determine which will be eligible for the mentorship program. This will be leaving job positions open. A query was created from different compan csv files that searches for employees with dates of birth from January 1, 1952- December 31, 1955. From these databases we searched for those eligible for the mentorship program whose dates of birth needed to be from January 1, 1965-January 31, 1965.
