This will be leaving job positions open. A query was created from different compan csv files that searches for employees with dates of birth from January 1, 1952- December 31, 1955. From these databases we searched for those eligible for the mentorship program whose dates of birth needed to be from January 1, 1965-January 31, 1965.
