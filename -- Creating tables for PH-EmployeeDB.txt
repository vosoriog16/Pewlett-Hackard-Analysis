-- Creating tables for PH-EmployeeDB
CREATE TABLE departments (
     dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
     dept_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
     PRIMARY KEY (dept_no),
     UNIQUE (dept_name)
);


Explanation:
    1st line: 
    *The very first line begins with a comment that clearly states the reason for the code. A SQL comment begins with two hyphens with no space between them: ( -- ). Clear and concise comments add to the readability of any coding project for yourself or any other developer who looks at it later. This one comment will apply to all of the CREATE TABLE statements, not just the one we are currently building.
    Lines 1-3: 
    *CREATE TABLE is the syntax required to create a new table in SQL.
departments is the name of the table and how it will be referenced in queries.
So the table has been named, now the structure needs to be created. The content inside the parentheses is how we'll do that.
dept_no VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL, creates a column named "dept_no" that can hold up to four varying characters, while NOT NULL tells SQL that no null fields will be allowed when importing data.
    Lines 4-6:
    dept_name VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, creates a column similar to the dept_no, only the varying character count has a maximum of 40.
PRIMARY KEY (dept_no), means that the dept_no column is used as the primary key for this table.
UNIQUE (dept_name) adds the unique constraint to the dept_name column.
    Last line:
    The closing parenthesis and semicolon signal that the SQL CREATE TABLE statement is complete.
